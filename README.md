# Responsiveness-Portfolio

My portfolio page is comprised of four sections. "Home" is the top of the page that welcomes the user and upon scrolling down, highlights the technologies I am skilled in. "About" gives a brief summary of who I am and why I do what I do. "Portfolio" lists the projects I helped work on during the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at UNC Charlotte. Finally, "Contact" allows the user to submit a form that is emailed to me directly.

In addition to the content summarized above, the site's layout is responsive based on the screen size of the user's device.
